# Project: Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!

<img src="static/shivansh.png" alt="workflow" width="70%">

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.

# Types of Recommendation System :

### 1 ) Content Based :

- Content-based systems, which use characteristic information and takes item attriubutes into consideration .

- Twitter , Youtube .

- Which music you are listening , what singer are you watching . Form embeddings for the features .
  
- User specific actions or similar items reccomendation .
  
- It will create a vector of it .
  
- These systems make recommendations using a user's item and profile features. They hypothesize that if a user was interested in an item in the past, they will once again be interested in it in the future
  
- One issue that arises is making obvious recommendations because of excessive specialization (user A is only interested in categories B, C, and D, and the system is not able to recommend items outside those categories, even though they could be interesting to them).

### 2 ) Collaborative Based :
    
- Collaborative filtering systems, which are based on user-item interactions.
  
- Clusters of users with same ratings , similar users .
  
- Book recommendation , so use cluster mechanism .
  
- We take only one parameter , ratings or comments .
  
- In short, collaborative filtering systems are based on the assumption that if a user likes item A and another user likes the same item A as well as another item, item B, the first user could also be interested in the second item . 
  
- Issues are :

  - User-Item nXn matrix , so computationally expensive .

  - Only famous items will get reccomended .

  - New items might not get reccomended at all .   

### 3 ) Hybrid Based :
  
- Hybrid systems, which combine both types of information with the aim of avoiding problems that are generated when working with just one kind.

- Combination of both and used now a days .

- Uses : word2vec , embedding .           

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.

## How to run the project?

1. Install all the libraries mentioned in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/kishan0725/Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.
2. Clone this repository in your local system.
3. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the `main.py` file.
4. Open the command prompt from your project directory and run the command `python main.py`.
5. Go to your browser and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in the address bar.
6. Hurray! That's it.

## Similarity Score : 

   How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here we use the similarity scores.
   
   It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
   
## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
